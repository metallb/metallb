Thanks for sending a pull request! A few things before we get started:

1. If this is your first time, please read the [contributing guide](https://metallb.universe.tf/community/#contributing)
2. For non-trivial pull requests, please [file an
   issue](https://github.com/google/metallb/issues/new) first, and get
   agreement that the change is a good idea, and a general guideline
   for how it should be implemented, before sending code. Large PRs
   that weren't first discussed and agreed upon in an issue won't be
   accepted.
3. If the PR fixes a particular bug, please include the words "Fixed
   #<issue number>" in the PR text, so that the bug auto-closes when
   the PR is merged.
