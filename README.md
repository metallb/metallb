### ðŸ”§ Feature: Optional BGP Controller via Environment Variable

This update introduces the ability to **disable MetalLB's BGP functionality** at runtime by setting an environment variable. This allows more flexible deployments, especially for users running MetalLB in **Layer 2-only mode**.

#### âœ… Summary of Changes

- **New Feature Flag**
  - Added support for the `METALLB_DISABLE_BGP=true` environment variable to conditionally disable BGP-related functionality.

- **New Utility Package**
  - Introduced `internal/env/env.go` with a helper function:
    ```go
    func BGPDisabled() bool {
        return strings.ToLower(os.Getenv("METALLB_DISABLE_BGP")) == "true"
    }
    ```

- **Controller Behavior (`controller/main.go`)**
  - BGP controller is only initialized if `METALLB_DISABLE_BGP` is not set to `true`.

- **Speaker Behavior (`speaker/main.go`)**
  - BGP speaker is conditionally initialized based on the same environment variable.
  - Passes `nil` to `speaker.Run()` if BGP is disabled.

- **Config Behavior (`internal/config/config.go`)**
  - Skips parsing and applying BGP configuration (`BGPPeers` and `BGPAdvertisements`) if BGP is disabled.

---

This feature allows MetalLB to cleanly operate in environments where BGP is not required, by omitting all BGP-related processing and controllers at runtime.
