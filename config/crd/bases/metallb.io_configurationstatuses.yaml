                  Conditions contains the status conditions from each controller.
                  Each condition reports the controller's reconciliation state:
                    - Status: True (valid) or False (invalid)
                    - Reason: The SyncState of the reconciler
                    - Message: Error message during reconcile, if any (empty if no error)

                  Example valid condition:
                    - type: speaker-<node-name>/frrk8sReconcilerValid
                      status: "True"

                      message: ""

                  Example invalid condition:
                    - type: speaker-<node-name>/frrk8sReconcilerValid
                      status: "False"

                        lastTransitionTime is the last time the condition transitioned from one status to another.
                        This should be when the underlying condition changed.  If that is not known, then using the time when the API field changed is acceptable.

                        observedGeneration represents the .metadata.generation that the condition was set based upon.
                        For instance, if .metadata.generation is currently 12, but the .status.conditions[x].observedGeneration is 9, the condition is out of date
                        with respect to the current state of the instance.
