                  The controller will use the pool with lowest value of priority in case of
                  multiple matches. A pool with no priority set will be used only if the
                  pools with priority can't be used. If multiple matching IPAddressPools are
                  available it will check for the availability of IPs sorting the matching
                  IPAddressPools by priority, starting from the highest to the lowest. If
                  multiple IPAddressPools have the same priority, choice will be random.
