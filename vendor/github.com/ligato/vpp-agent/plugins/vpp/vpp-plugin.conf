# This is the example configuration file for VPP plugin. Below is a description of all possible items which can be set
# to modify VPP plugin default behaviour.

# Default maximum transmission unit. The value is used if an interface without MTU is created (it means MTU in
# interface configuration is preferred).
mtu: 0

# VPP plugin resync strategy. Available options are [full] and [optimize]. Full strategy is default, and always performs
# the resync, optimize can be used for cold start; it looks for interface configuration looking for interfaces. If there
# is none, VPP is considered empty and resync is skipped.
strategy: full

# VPP agent allows to send status data back to ETCD. To allow it, add desired status publishers. Currently supported
# for [etcd] and [redis] (both options can be chosen together)
