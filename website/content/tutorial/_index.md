There are two tutorials available, showcasing different facets of
MetalLB.

The [BGP on Minikube tutorial]({{% relref "minikube.md" %}}) sets up
MetalLB in a Minikube sandbox, and showcases BGP load-balancing in a
simulated environment. If you don't have a bare metal cluster to test
on yet, or if you want to explore MetalLB's BGP functionality, this is
the tutorial for you.

The [ARP tutorial]({{% relref "arp.md" %}}) demonstrates setting up
ARP mode. For this tutorial you will need to bring your own bare metal
cluster, unfortunately we don't yet have a Minikube-friendly
demonstration for ARP mode.
