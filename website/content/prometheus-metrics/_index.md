#### Note: all the metrics related to a BGP session contain a label that refers to the bgppeer the session is opened against. For example, with 4 BGP peers, the `metallb_bgp_updates_total` metric could appear as the following:
```bash
# HELP metallb_bgp_updates_total Number of BGP UPDATE messages sent
# TYPE metallb_bgp_updates_total counter
metallb_bgp_updates_total{peer="172.23.0.5:0"} 1
metallb_bgp_updates_total{peer="172.23.0.6:0"} 1
metallb_bgp_updates_total{peer="172.30.0.2:0"} 1
metallb_bgp_updates_total{peer="172.30.0.3:0"} 1
