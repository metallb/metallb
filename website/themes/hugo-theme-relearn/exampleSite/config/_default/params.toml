# Relearn Theme
# These options are specific to the Relearn theme.

#++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
# Branding
# These options set your overall visual apperance.

# Used color variants.
# Default: "auto"
# This sets one or more color variants, available to your readers to choose
# from. You can
# - set a single value eg. "zen-light"
# - an array like [ "neon", "learn" ]
# - an array with options like [ { identifier = "neon" },{ identifier = "learn" } ]
# The last form allows to set further options for each variant.
# The `identifier` is mandatory. You can also set `name` which overrides the
# value displayed in the variant selector.
# If the array has more than one entry, a variant selector
# is shown in the lower part of the menu. The first entry in the array is the
# default variant, used for first time visitors.
# The theme ships with the following variants: "relearn-bright",
# "relearn-light", "relearn-dark", "zen-light", "zen-dark", "neon", "learn",
# "blue", "green", "red". In addition you can use auto mode variants. See the
# docs for a detailed explaination.
# You can also define your own variants. See the docs how this works. Also,
# the docs provide an interactive theme generator to help you with this task.

# experience this, you can first try to set the `--noChmod` option for Hugo.

# off in certain circumstances. For example if you have Hugo's dev server
# running. Also some proxies dislike this optimization.

# Avoid generator meta tags.
# Default: false
# Set this to true if you want to disable generation for generator meta tags
# of Hugo and the theme in your HTML head. In tihs case also don't forget to
# set Hugo's disableHugoGeneratorInject=true. Otherwise Hugo will generate a
# meta tag into your home page anyways.
disableGeneratorVersion = false

# Avoid unique IDs.
# Default: false

# in HTML fragment links. This can be undesirable for example when testing
# the output for changes. If you disable the random id generation, the theme
# may not function correctly anymore.

# Multilanguage content.
# Default: not set
# If your pages contain further languages besides the main one used, add all

# Additional code dependencies.
# Default: See hugo.toml of the theme

# See the docs how this works.

# If no `${FilePath}` is given in the value, the value is treated as if the
